viso-ontology
=============

The current [Visualization Ontology](http://purl.org/viso/) (VISO). Statements from the [legacy VISO ontology](https://github.com/viso-ontology/legacy-ontologies) are moved here as needed by the VISO users.

For details look into our [WIKI pages](https://github.com/viso-ontology/viso-ontology/wiki).

At the moment the modules "graphic" and "data" have the most actively migrated, since they are used in the [RVL project](https://github.com/semvis/rvl).

The usage for code generation in RVL is also the reason for some extra files in the folder "/modules/graphic-for-rvl-codegen".
