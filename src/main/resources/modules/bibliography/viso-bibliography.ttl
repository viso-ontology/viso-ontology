      bibo:shortDescription
              "In human-media interactions, visualizations occur in a large variety of forms. However, they remain but a single form of possible feedback towards a user. In this chapter it is argued that human-centered visualization is a fundamental part of human-media interaction and vice versa. To that end, the focus in this chapter lies first on the more general topic of interaction research, thus providing a solid literary ground for the rest of this chapter (Section 3.1). In Section 3.2 the focus shifts towards the question how a display technology influences the way(s) in which interaction with visualization takes place. This path is then broadened in Section 3.3 by focusing on approaches towards interacting multimodally with visualizations. To that end a chronological overview of developments in that field is given, thus providing an insight of trends and required steps in realizing multimodal interactions. Also, future work in this field is deducted from literature and those development trends. Fourthly, Section 3.4 describes the issues at hand for effectively applying visualizations in group-based collaborative and distributed environments. The aim in this chapter is to provide an overview of developments and the current state-of-the-art of approaches in which visualization supports the human-machine interaction process and vice versa. For that, this chapter is finalized with a short summary of issues to deal with while designing interaction for visualization. In addition current and future challenges in interacting with visualizations will be discussed."^^xsd:string ;

              "the description of the user-system interaction plays a crucial role  in adaptive interactive systems, since the adaptations depend on  this description. user actions in interactive systems can be described  as a sequence of events, which are created by input through input  devices as well as by the system as reactions to these inputs. an  interactive system can observe these events and thus extract information  about the users behavior. this paper presents a two-step approach  for describing user behavior from sequences of basic events. first,  user actions are recognized in the sequence of interaction events  by means of previously trained probabilistic automata. second, a  task model describes the higher-level user activity as a hierarchical  composition of these actions. different kinds of adaptive support  can be derived from this description of user behavior, such as recommending  next interaction steps to the user."^^xsd:string ;

              "Component-based development (CBD) has become an important emerging topic in the software engineering field. It promises long-sought-after benefits such as increased software reuse, reduced development time to market and, hence, reduced software production cost. Despite the huge potential, the lack of reasoning support and development environment of component modeling and verification may hinder its development. Methods and tools that can support component model analysis are highly appreciated by industry. Such a tool support should be fully automated as well as efficient. At the same time, the reasoning tool should scale up well as it may need to handle hundreds or even thousands of components that a modern software system may have. Furthermore, a distributed environment that can effectively manage and compose components is also desirable. In this paper, we present an approach to the modeling and verification of a newly proposed component model using Semantic Web languages and their reasoning tools. We use the Web Ontology Language and the Semantic Web Rule Language to precisely capture the inter-relationships and constraints among the entities in a component model. Semantic Web reasoning tools are deployed to perform automated analysis support of the component models. Moreover, we also proposed a service-oriented architecture (SOA)-based semantic web environment for CBD. The adoption of Semantic Web services and SOA make our component environment more reusable, scalable, dynamic and adaptive."^^xsd:string ;

Information visualization and visual data mining can help to deal with the flood of information. The advantage of visual data exploration is that the user is directly involved in the data mining process. There are a large number of information visualization techniques which have been developed over the last decade to support the exploration of large data sets. In this paper, we propose a classification of information visualization and visual data mining techniques which is based on the data type to be visualized, the visualization technique, and the interaction and distortion technique. We exemplify the classification using a few examples, most of them referring to techniques and systems presented in this special section." ;

      dct:abstract "Information visualization encounters a wide variety of different data domains. The visualization community has developed representation methods and interactive techniques. As a community, we have realized that the requirements in each domain are often dramatically different. In order to easily apply existing methods, researchers have developed a semiology of graphic representations. We have extended this research into a framework that includes operators and interactions in visualization systems, such as a visualization spreadsheet. We discuss properties of this framework and use it to characterize operations spanning a variety of different visualization techniques. The framework developed in this paper enables a new way of exploring and evaluating the design space of visualization operators, and helps end--users in their analysis tasks." ;

      dct:abstract "<p>In previous work, researchers have attempted to construct<br/>taxonomies of information visualization techniques by examining the data<br/>domains that are compatible with these techniques. This is useful<br/>because implementers can quickly identify various techniques that can be<br/>applied to their domain of interest. However, these taxonomies do not<br/>help the implementers understand how to apply and implement these<br/>techniques. The author extends and proposes a new way to taxonomize<br/>information visualization techniques by using the Data State Model (E.H.<br/>Chi and J.T. Reidl, 1998). In fact, as the taxonomic analysis in the<br/>paper will show, many of the techniques share similar operating steps<br/>that can easily be reused. The paper shows that the Data State Model not<br/>only helps researchers understand the space of design, but also helps<br/>implementers understand how information visualization techniques can be<br/>applied more broadly</p>" ;

      dct:abstract "We present a novel high-level visualization taxonomy. Our taxonomy classifies visualization algorithms rather than data. Algorithms are categorized based on the assumptions they make about the data being visualized; we call this set of assumptions the design model. Because our taxonomy is based on design models, it is more flexible than existing taxonomies and considers the user's conceptual model, emphasizing the human aspect of visualization. Design models are classified according to whether they are discrete or continuous and by how much the algorithm designer chooses display attributes such as spatialization, timing, colour, and transparency. This novel approach provides an alternative view of the visualization field that helps explain how traditional divisions (e.g., information and scientific visualization) relate and overlap, and that may inspire research ideas in hybrid visualization areas." ;

We present a set of ten low level analysis tasks that largely capture people's activities while employing information visualization tools for understanding data. To help develop these tasks, we collected nearly 200 sample questions from students about how they would analyze five particular data sets from different domains. The questions, while not being totally comprehensive, illustrated the sheer variety of analytic questions typically posed by users when employing information visualization systems. We hope that the presented set of tasks is useful for information visualization system designers as a kind of common substrate to discuss the relative analytic capabilities of the systems. Further, the tasks may provide a form of checklist for system designers.</p>" ;

Understanding the differences between information visualization and other forms of visual communication provides important insights into the way the field works, though, and also shows the path to new approaches. We propose a classification of several types of information visualization based on aesthetic criteria. The notions of artistic and pragmatic visualization are introduced, and their properties discussed. Finally, the idea of visualization criticism is proposed, and its rules are laid out. Visualization criticism bridges the gap between design, art, and technical/pragmatic information visualization.

To improve user satisfaction, we propose equipping the widget with a novel text filter to dynamically limit the slider range. In this way, users are supported in locating target items and in identifying records that are missing. The results of a comparative user evaluation run on a Personal Digital Assistant showed that 8 out of 12 participants preferred the filter widget to the classic interface. We further suggest an enhanced Alphaslider design to speed up user interaction." ;

      dct:abstract "<p> Visualizers, like logicians, have long been concerned with meaning. Generalizing from MacEachren's overview of cartography, visualizers have to think about how people extract meaning from pictures (psychophysics), what people understand from a picture (cognition), how pictures are imbued with meaning (semiotics), and how in some cases that meaning arises within a social and/or cultural context. If we think of the communication acts carried out in the visualization process further levels of meaning are suggested. Visualization begins when someone has data that they wish to explore and interpret; the data are encoded as input to a visualization system, which may in its turn interact with other systems to produce a representation. This is communicated back to the user(s), who have to assess this against their goals and knowledge, possibly leading to further cycles of activity. Each phase of this process involves communication between two parties. For this to succeed, those parties must share a common language with an agreed meaning. We offer the following three steps, in increasing order of formality: terminology (jargon), taxonomy (vocabulary), and ontology. Our argument in this article is that it's time to begin synthesizing the fragments and views into a level 3 model, an ontology of visualization. We also address why this should happen, what is already in place, how such an ontology might be constructed, and why now.</p>" ;

The result is a visualization assistant called ViA, a system that collaborates with its users to identify perceptually salient visualizations for large, multidimensional datasets. ViA applies knowledge of low-level human vision to: (1) evaluate the effectiveness of a particular visualization for a given dataset and analysis tasks; and (2) rapidly direct its search towards new visualizations that are most likely to offer improvements over those seen to date. Context, domain expertise, and a high-level understanding of a dataset are critical to identifying effective visualizations. We apply a mixed-initiative strategy that allows ViA and its users to share their different strengths and continually improve ViA's understanding of a user's preferences. We visualize historical weather conditions to compare ViA's search strategy to exhaustive analysis, simulated annealing, and reactive tabu search, and to measure the improvement provided by mixed-initiative interaction. We also visualize intelligent agents competing in a simulated online auction to evaluate ViA's perceptual guidelines. Results from each study are positive, suggesting that ViA can construct high-quality visualizations for a range of real-world datasets." ;

A few frameworks and taxonomies of Infovis interaction techniques exist, but they typically focus on low-level operations and do not address the variety of benefits interaction provides. After conducting an extensive review of Infovis systems and their interactive capabilities, we propose seven general categories of interaction techniques widely used in Infovis: 1) Select, 2) Explore, 3) Reconfigure, 4) Encode, 5) Abstract/Elaborate, 6) Filter, and 7) Connect. These categories are organized around a user's intent while interacting with a system rather than the low-level interaction techniques provided by a system. The categories can act as a framework to help discuss and evaluate interaction techniques and hopefully lay an initial foundation toward a deeper understanding and a science of interaction.</p>" ;

While work in this area has relied on either manually recorded provenance (e.g., user notes) or automatically recorded event-based insight provenance (e.g., clicks, drags, and key-presses), both approaches have fundamental limitations. Our aim is to develop a new approach that combines the benefits of both approaches while avoiding their deficiencies. Toward this goal, we characterize userspsila visual analytic activity at multiple levels of granularity. Moreover, we identify a critical level of abstraction, Actions, that can be used to represent visual analytic activity with a set of general but semantically meaningful behavior types. In turn, the action types can be used as the semantic building blocks for insight provenance. We present a catalog of common actions identified through observations of several different visual analytic systems. In addition, we define a taxonomy to categorize actions into three major classes based on their semantic intent. The concept of actions has been integrated into our labpsilas prototype visual analytic system, HARVEST, as the basis for its insight provenance capabilities."^^xsd:string ;

In order to make good choices, an understanding of the purpose and meaning of visualization is needed. Especially, it would be nice if we could assess what a good visualization is. In this paper an attempt is made to determine the value of visualization. A technological viewpoint is adopted, where the value of visualization is measured based on effectiveness and efficiency. An economic model of visualization is presented, and benefits and costs are established. Next, consequences for and limitations of visualization are discussed (including the use of alternative methods, high initial costs, subjectiveness, and the role of interaction), as well as examples of the use of the model for the judgement of existing classes of methods and understanding why they are or are not used in practice. Furthermore, two alternative views on visualization are presented and discussed: viewing visualization as an art or as a scientific discipline. Implications and future directions are identified." ;

We believe that the greatest challenge is reaching a consensus within the visualization community itself. This poster is intended as one step in this process, setting out the perceived needs for the ontology, and sketching initial directions. It is hoped that this will lead to debate, feedback and involvement across the community." ;

      dct:abstract "Although recorded demonstrations (screen capture animations with narration) have become a popular form of instruction for user interfaces, little work has been done to describe guidelines for their design. Based on our experience in several projects, we offer a starting set of guidelines for the design of visually appealing and cognitively effective recorded demonstrations. Technical guidelines encourage users to keep file sizes small, strive for universal usability, and ensure user control etc. and provide tips to achieve those goals. Content guidelines include: create short demonstrations that focus on tasks, highlight each step with auditory and visual cues, synchronize narration and animation carefully, and create demonstrations with a clear beginning, middle, and end." ;

      dct:abstract "<p> A great challenge in information visualization today is to provide models and software that effectively integrate the graphics content of scenes with domain-specific knowledge so that the users can effectively query, interpret, personalize and manipulate the visualized information [1]. Moreover, it is important that the intelligent visualization applications are interoperable in the semantic web environment and thus, require that the models and software supporting them integrate state-of-the-art international standards for knowledge representation, graphics and multimedia. In this paper, we present a model, a methodology and a software framework for the semantic web (Intelligent 3D Visualization Platform - I3DVP) for the development of interoperable intelligent visualization applications that support the coupling of graphics and virtual reality scenes with domain knowledge of different domains. The graphics content and the semantics of the scenes are married into a consistent and cohesive ontological model while at the same time knowledge- based techniques for the querying, manipulation, and semantic personalization of the scenes are introduced. We also provide methods for knowledge driven information visualization and visualization- aided decision making based on inference by reasoning.</p>" ;

In this paper, we suggest a list of tasks we believe are commonly encountered while analyzing graph data. We define graph specific objects and demonstrate how all complex tasks could be seen as a series of low-level tasks performed on those objects. We believe that our taxonomy, associated with benchmark datasets and specific tasks, would help evaluators generalize results collected through a series of controlled experiments." ;

VisIOn will allow users and developers to quickly find systems related to their needs or interests. Also, this site will serve as a collection point for information about SV tools through which developers can disseminate their work and make it available to their target community in a timely manner. VisIOn incorporates attributes identified in earlier taxonomies but emphasizes the notion of effectiveness. In the context of Software Visualization, we define effectiveness as how well a system can be used by an SV designer to communicate information to the SV viewer. In developing an SV ontology, we seek to clarify the meaning of effectiveness in the SV domain and to reconcile the terminology introduced in various SV taxonomy papers. In related work, we are conducting studies that we hope will help reduce some of the subjectivity and difficulty involved in rating the effectiveness of SV systems and of visualizations created using these systems." ;

Furthermore, the selection mechanism may be generalized using a painting metaphor to specify arbitrary, disconnected intervals while maintaining an intuitive user-interface." ;

      dct:abstract "The goal of the research described in this paper is to develop an application-independent presentation tool that automatically designs effective graphical presentations (such as bar charts, scatter plots, and connected graphs) of relational information. Two problems are raised by this goal: The codification of graphic design criteria in a form that can be used by the presentation tool, and the generation of a wide variety of designs so that the presentation tool can accommodate a wide variety of information. The approach described in this paper is based on the view that graphical presentations are sentences of graphical languages. The graphic design issues are codified as expressiveness and effectiveness criteria for graphical languages. Expressiveness criteria determine whether a graphical language can express the desired information. Effectiveness criteria determine whether a graphical language exploits the capabilities of the output medium and the human visual system. A wide variety of designs can be systematically generated by using a composition algebra that composes a small set of primitive graphical languages. Artificial intelligence techniques are used to implement a prototype presentation tool called APT (A Presentation Tool), which is based on the composition algebra and the graphic design criteria." ;

      dct:abstract "A multiple view system uses two or more distinct views to support the investigation of a single conceptual entity. Many such systems exist, ranging from computer-aided design (CAD) systems for chip design that display both the logical structure and the actual geometry of the integrated circuit to overview-plus-detail systems that show both an overview for context and a zoomed-in-view for detail. Designers of these systems must make a variety of design decisions, ranging from determining layout to constructing sophisticated coordination mechanisms. Surprisingly, little work has been done to characterize these systems or to express guidelines for their design. Based on a workshop discussion of multiple views, and based on our own design and implementation experience with these systems, we present eight guidelines for the design of multiple view systems." ;

Founded on Jacques Bertin’s practical experience as a cartographer, Part One of this work is an unprecedented attempt to synthesize principles of graphic communication with the logic of standard rules applied to writing and topography. Part Two brings Bertin’s theory to life, presenting a close study of graphic techniques including shape, orientation, color, texture, volume, and size in an array of more than 1,000 maps and diagrams."^^xsd:string ;

In studies, users reacted to this approach with an enthusiasm more commonly associated with video games. Adoption requires research into retrieval and display algorithms and user-interface design. The author discusses how experts may benefit from visual interfaces because they will be able to formulate more complex queries and interpret intricate results." ;
